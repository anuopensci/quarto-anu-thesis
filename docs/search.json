    "text": "Benefits\nThe benefits of using Quarto document include:\n\nIt allows you to write your thesis in a simple markup language called Markdown. This means that you can focus on writing your thesis without having to worry about formatting.\nThe document can be output to a variety of formats including PDF, HTML, Word, and LaTeX.\nCode can be easily embedded in the document and executed. This means that you can include the results of your analysis in your thesis without having to manually copy and paste them. This is a good reproducible and scientific practice.\nYou can easily integrate with aspects of GitHub (edit, reporting an issue, etc).\n\nThe above outlined benefits can also be considered as best practice. Version controlling and collaborative writing (via Git and GitHub) are important in managing multiple versions of your thesis and in collaborating with your supervisory team. Embedding code in your thesis is a good practice in reproducible research. Making your thesis in HTML format can allow for interactive web elements to be embedded while PDF format can be for general distribution and printing.",

Unfortunately, there is no equivalent system with track changes in Quarto. You can output the tex file from Quarto document and use this in Overleaf. The changes made in this tex document however has to be manually transferred back to the Quarto document. If your main output is mainly mathematical and you have little to no code outputs, Overleaf is probably a better choice.",
